  title: "Automating Email Verifications and SMS Interactions"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">
                <h5>Scavenging the Mailbox: Automating Email Verifications</h2>Test automation engineers have encountered numerous headaches in dealing with testing email verifications.
                <br><br>
                Some test automation engineers have been caught in snare where they tackled the problem using email retrieval via REST APIs like Mailosaur and GMail. However, this approach made the automation engineers dependent on the webmail provider. Furthermore, if the APIs of these webmail providers change, though very seldom, automation engineers need to adjust their scripts. Moreover, usage of Mailosaur API comes with a cost. To make things worst, I’ve seen automation engineers relying on Selenium to scrape the emails; which is very time expensive and very brittle.
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, the best efficient approach to this problem is to observe how our email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird and other Android email clients seamlessly fetch our emails across various webmail providers - which is via IMAP(S). This presentation will talk about the whats and the hows of automating email verifications using IMAP(S), more specifically using Robot Framework’s IMAP Library.
                <h5>Surviving a Paranoid Girlfriend: Automating SMS Interactions</h2>
                Test automation engineers have encountered numerous headaches in dealing with automating SMS interactions.
                <br><br>
                Some test automation engineers have been caught in snare where they tackled the problem using the mmssms.db database file of a rooted Android device. Some uses CodeOn’s SMS Gateway API which requires an Internet connectivity to access their server. Some uses paid version of third party SMS Gateway APIs like Twilio. To make things worst, I’ve seen some automation engineers relying on Appium to scrape the SMS; which is very time expensive and very brittle.
                <br><br>
                In my opinion, the best efficient approach to this problem is to exploit the Perfness’s REST SMS Gateway Android app. This app does not require rooted Android device, Internet connectivity, money, nor being UI-dependent. This presentation will talk about the whats and the hows of automating, both sending and receiving, SMS using the aforementioned Android app and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB)."

  title: "Complexity, Testing Without Testers, and the Future of Software Testing"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Complexity science informs us why there is a massive-progressive paradigm shift in software testing: favorability of automation, QA commodification, obsolescence of specialist testers, and devops-ification of QE (and why your ISTQB certification is useless).
                <br><br>
                The reason? Humanity’s ruthless quest to reduce uncertainty.
                <br><br>
                In this talk I’ll share how we built a high-quality digital bank without dedicated testers, and what it means to the future of software testing."

                In this talk an opensource tool will be introduced called Caldera.
                Specifically,  different attack combinations will be emulated in real time through a trojan attack on multiple virtual machines."

  description: "<p align=\"justify\">Software development has always centered around testing and quality. Most of the time, QA efforts are centered in Functional Testing, checking that the software meets initial requirements. However, experts in areas such as exploratory testing, performance testing, usability and user-experience testing know that we had much more work to do than just functional testing.  In this talk, I'll focus on Usability Testing and how our team manage to incorporate it with our Functional Testing to save time, effort and money in our projects."

  title: "Beyond the Turing Test: Evaluating AI Systems"
  description: "<p align=\"justify\">
                The possibilities and impact of AI means that more AI systems will be created in the future. In order for these AI systems to gain widespread acceptance and unlock their true potential, it is important that they be constructed correctly and thoroughly evaluated. Testing is an important activity in the evaluation process. Due to the complex nature of AI systems, the traditional methods of testing as applied to AI are insufficient. Testing therefore needs to be supplemented by newer types of activities specifically geared towards AI. These newer set of activities further imply that resources doing the testing have other skill sets that enable them to perform these new activities. This talk will zero in on what these new activities are such as Metamorphic Testing, Curated Data sets and AI behavior evaluation. It will also discuss the skills needed to perform these activities.
